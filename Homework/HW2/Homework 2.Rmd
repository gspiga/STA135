# Problem 3

a.)
```{r}
scores <- read.table("~/GitHub/STA135/Homework/HW2/T5-2.dat")

meanalt <- c(500, 50, 30)

library(DescTools)
HotellingsT2Test(scores, mu = meanalt, test = 'chi')

#Finding the critical point

n = nrow(scores)
p = ncol(scores)

Fstat = qf(0.05, p, n - p, lower.tail =  FALSE)
critval <- ((n -1) * p) / (n - p) * Fstat

```
Given that our $T^2$ value is much larger than our critical value as well as our p-value is extremely close to zero, we reject $H_0$. We have reason to believe that students are scoring differently than the reported average scores. 

b.)
```{r}
S <- cov(scores)

eigVal <-eigen(S)$values 
eigVec <- eigen(S)$vectors

```
