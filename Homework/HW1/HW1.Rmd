### Problem 1.6
# a.)
```{r}
airpol <-
  read.csv("~/GitHub/STA135/Homework/HW1/Air-Pollution Data G.C.Tao.csv",
           header = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)

colnames <- names(airpol)
for (i in colnames[-1]){
  print(ggMarginal(ggplot(airpol, aes_string(x = "Wind..x1.", y = i)) + geom_point(color = 'firebrick'), type = 'histogram', fill = 'dodgerblue'))

}

```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
